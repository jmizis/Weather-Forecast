# Weather-Forecast

## Description

This challenge wanted us to create a weather forecast application that would show us the hourly forecast followed by a five day forecast of a any city you searched. There was no starter code given to us, we started from scratch. First I started with the html making sure I have my html linked with bootscrap and css. Next I created my title named "Weather Forecast" and next came the header for the site. Next came the main where you can find the search-input for the city you will be searching followed by two more sections. First will be the current weather of the city searched followed by the 5 day forecast. At the bottom of the html you can find my scripts for jquery, moment, and my script.js



## API 

For the api you were given the site to go on: https://openweathermap.org/api/one-call-api. On the open weather map I was able to find three diferent api calls to use. As you can see in my script.js I used one for the search value, one for the hourly forecast, and another one for my five day forecast. 


## Github 

On Github I was able to create a new repository where I was able to push all my work to. Before even starting the challenge I had to clone the new repository to the my computer first. I cloned it using my gitbash, from there on any code I worked on visual studio code I was able to save it and push it back to my repository. Once all my work was done I did a final push and created a deployed site.

## Conclusion

This challenge was tougher than the previous ones but it's a great way to show off our newly learned shill to be able to work with api's. Finding a api is the easy part but picking it apart in the concole can be tough. But at the end I took my time and looked through all the information that was giving me and I was able to find the data I needed to complete the challenge.
